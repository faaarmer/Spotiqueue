;;; This file is read by Spotiqueue as soon as it starts up.  It exposes some helpers and hooks for
;;; users.

;; Dragons, continued: we grab our file location, but go up one level before adding to load-path.
;; The reason for this is that we want to call this module (spotiqueue init), so it has to live in a
;; spotiqueue folder with its siblings.

(format #t "%load-path = ~s\n" %load-path)

(add-to-load-path (canonicalize-path (string-append (dirname (current-filename)) file-name-separator-string "..")))

;; TODO find out a way we can make this module sensibly loadable from `guile' in the shell without
;; having Spotiqueue running...  Is that even useful?

;; If i want to use this module naming scheme i should have the source files in a folder called `spotiqueue'.  Grr, there are already so many of those i'll just nest them in guile/spotiqueue i guess.
