# TODO list


## Other

* Automatically switch audio output sink when using Sound.prefpane - https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/327

* Copying and pasting of spotify URIs

* Media keys, globally

* total remaining queue time

# Ideas

* Some sort of local "filter results" function.  Press "/" or something?
  present only items matching (regex) filter in at least one of their fields?


# Lower priority

* Save queue to .. NSUserDefaults? Text file?

* Loved tracks retrieval
* Add/remove star

* All playlists retrieval
* Create playlist.. maybe?

* Play/pause button

* Deal with incorrect username/password gracefully.

* better logging framework, show messages in Console.app.

* FIX: blocking on get-all-albums for artist with many albums. Should
  be background job. Eg. search for beethoven, cmd-right twice in a
  row. Boom.
