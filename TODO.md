# TODO list

* Make sure that if user pastes URIs into queue, they're all the same kind.

* Allow pasting lists of:
  - [x] tracks
  - [ ] albums
  - [ ] playlists
  - won't support artist URI - just use search & browse!

* Cmd-O to put list of all playlists into search results
* Cmd-right gets all tracks if a playlist is selected, enter enqueues
  entire playlist


## Other

* Automatically switch audio output sink when using Sound.prefpane - https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/327

* Media keys, globally

# Ideas

* Some sort of local "filter results" function (in search view).  Press "/" or something?
  present only items matching (regex) filter in at least one of their fields?


# Lower priority

* Save queue to .. NSUserDefaults? Text file?  On termination.

* When loading, if list of tracks found in NSUserDefaults, populate queue.

* Loved tracks retrieval
* Add/remove star

* All playlists retrieval
* Create playlist.. maybe? By default suggest name "Artist - Album"
  based on first selected item?  Or based on current queue?

* Deal with incorrect username/password gracefully.

* better logging framework, show messages in Console.app.

* FIX: blocking on get-all-albums for artist with many albums. Should
  be background job. Eg. search for beethoven, cmd-right twice in a
  row. Boom.

* Deal with user pasting `spotify:......` URI into search bar.

* Everywhere you can paste spotify URIs, consider allowing
  `https://open.spotify.com...` URLs, too.

* Create README with instructions for building, codesign, sparkle
  update, and especially the `ditto....` incantation and how `zip -r`
  breaks notarisation... https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/677186

* When moving tracks in queue consider scrolling such that there's a
  3-4 track "buffer" of not-selected tracks between the selected block
  and the edge of the view.


* Pasting would be much easier if we didn't bother batching and dealt
  with each entry one-by-one... ðŸ¤”

* Little Credits or Help screen

* Why are the table column headers sometimes differently-coloured???

* when copying: _intersperse_ with `\n`, don't append to every line.
