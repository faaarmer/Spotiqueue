# TODO list

* Automatically switch audio output sink when using Sound.prefpane
* Album browse
* Artist browse
* Duration song countdown

* Keep track of current playback status: playing/paused/stopped
* Play/pause with spacebar

* Copying and pasting of spotify URIs
* Dragging items position in queue
* Dragging items into queue from search


# Ideas

* Keep track of last-searched: free-text, album, or artist, and if you've cmd-right'ed to get an album, doing it again gets the artist's tracks/albums?
* If doing album-browse, put "album:..." into the search bar?

* Search: if searching for "album:...URI..." plus a term, maybe filter results (locally) on those terms?





# Lower priority

* ...constraints? SwiftUI? ...?
* Better column widths in TableView üôÅ

* Nicer login and auth flow.  Maybe use OAUTH for worker, too.
* Save queue to .. NSUserDefaults? Text file?

* Loved tracks retrieval
* Add/remove star

* All playlists retrieval
* Create playlist.. maybe?



* Search: Does "album:asdf" make sense? Search for "asdf" in album titles?  why not _just_ search for "asdf"?  Maybe park that idea until it turns out i'm often failing to find what i'm after in one go.
