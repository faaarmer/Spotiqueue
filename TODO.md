# TODO list

## Before it's ready for showing people

* Sparkle framework or other auto update


## Other

* page up / down should bring focussed row along for the ride.

* Automatically switch audio output sink when using Sound.prefpane

* Copying and pasting of spotify URIs
* Dragging items position in queue
* Dragging items into queue from search

* Media keys, globally

* total remaining queue time

# Ideas

* If doing album-browse, put "album:..." into the search bar?

* Search: if searching for "album:...URI..." plus a term, maybe filter results (locally) on those terms?

* Some sort of local "filter results" function.  Press "/" or something?
  present only items matching (regex) filter in at least one of their fields?


# Lower priority

* Save queue to .. NSUserDefaults? Text file?

* Loved tracks retrieval
* Add/remove star

* All playlists retrieval
* Create playlist.. maybe?

* Search: Does "album:asdf" make sense? Search for "asdf" in album titles?  why not _just_ search for "asdf"?  Maybe park that idea until it turns out i'm often failing to find what i'm after in one go.

* Play/pause button

* Deal with incorrect username/password.

* Show popup or something when successfully received callback from
  spotify for authorisation.  Something to the effect of "you may
  close the browser window"

* better logging framework, show messages in Console.app.
