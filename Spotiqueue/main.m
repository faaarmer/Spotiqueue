        /* This deserves some explanation.  We really don't want Spotiqueue to rely on users doing
         * `brew install guile` -- that would exclude half the world that doesn't like terminals.  So,
         * we vendor in the Guile stdlib.  However, that's not enough, because if my guile*.a file was
         * compiled in a different location than someone else's Guile installation path (e.g. the
         * Homebrew 3.0.7 vs 3.0.7_1 path issue) the built-in %load-path won't match up with theirs!
         * Subsequently (yes, there's more) if i don't also bundle in the ccache (*.go files) then at
         * startup Spotiqueue thinks its own stdlib is newer than the user's one and busily starts
         * compiling.  No bueno.  So we package up both the stdlib source & compiled files, and
         * manually tweak the search paths so that we're sure that only those files will be used.  Not
         * great, but it seems to work, and best of all, folks won't need to install Guile themselves
         * if they don't want to.
